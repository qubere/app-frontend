/**
 * One line of metering for an agent's model call.
 *
 * The agents were written before there was any accounting, and they run in places
 * where nothing is watching: a cron sweep, a queued document, a server render of
 * a shipment page. The rule this file exists to keep is that adding accounting to
 * them changes nothing about what they produce.
 *
 * So `meterGeminiCall` cannot refuse, cannot throw, and cannot alter the response.
 * It takes what the call already returned, reads the usage the provider attached
 * to it, and records it. An agent that is metered and an agent that is not metered
 * classify identically.
 *
 * Enforcement is a separate decision made at the route, before any work starts —
 * see `checkAiQuota`. Deliberately not here: refusing halfway through a
 * classification would leave a shipment in a state no screen knows how to show.

 * Awaited by callers so the write lands before a serverless instance can be
 * frozen, but it is two indexed upserts against a call that already took seconds,
