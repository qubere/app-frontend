/**
 * A shared quota and meter for everything on this platform that spends model
 * tokens.
 *
 * ## Why this exists
 *
 * Every AI surface here — the Copilot, HTS classification, document
 * intelligence, product intelligence, normalization, the compliance audit and
 * email intake — bills against one `GEMINI_API_KEY`. Until this module there was
 * exactly one limit anywhere in the codebase, an in-memory counter in front of
 * the Copilot, which means:
 *
 *   - it was per server instance, so the real ceiling was the configured ceiling
 *     times the number of warm instances, and a cold start forgot everything;
 *   - the other six surfaces had no ceiling at all.
 *
 * Counters live in Postgres because the database is the only thing every
 * instance shares. Each increment is a single atomic statement, so two instances
 * racing on the same account cannot both read "14 of 15" and both proceed.
 *
 * ## Fixed windows, not sliding
 *
 * A window is a truncated minute (for request counts) or a UTC day (for token
 * totals). That is weaker than the sliding window the in-memory limiter uses: a
 * caller can spend the tail of one minute and the head of the next, so a burst
 * of up to twice the nominal rate is possible at a boundary. It is the trade for
 * one indexed upsert instead of a read-modify-write, and for a cost guard that
 * is the right trade — stated here rather than discovered later.
 *
 * ## A limit that is not configured is not enforced
 *
 * This is the rule that keeps the module from changing how anything behaves
 * today. With no environment variables set, every call is metered and every call
 * is allowed. The Copilot keeps the request ceiling it already had; the agents
 * get ceilings only when an operator sets one.
 *
 * ## Failure is not enforcement
 *
 * If the counter cannot be read or written — the migration has not been applied
 * yet, the pool is exhausted, the database is briefly unreachable — the request
 * is ALLOWED and the decision is marked degraded. A metering table must never be
 * able to take down customs classification. Every degraded decision is logged,
 * because silence would make an outage look like normal operation.
