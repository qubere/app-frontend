/**
 * Drives the document processing pipeline one bounded pass at a time.
 *
 * On a long-running host, `src/worker/documentWorker.ts` calls the same
 * `runWorkerTick()` in a loop, and request handlers call it too; all three are
 * safe to run simultaneously because every state transition is a conditional
 * update against the durable Postgres run.
 *
 * A tick does not wait for the parser: it submits what is due, polls what is
 * due, finishes what is ready, and returns. A document mid-conversion is picked
 * up by the next tick, so no HTTP request is ever held open on the provider.
 *
 * GET is the entry point because that is what Cloud Scheduler issues, matching
 * `/api/cron/hts-refresh`. It is gated on `CRON_SECRET` and it processes only
 * work that already exists: it advances durable runs and never creates
 * documents, demo data, exceptions, or shipments.
 *
 * This is a **backstop, not the pipeline**. One tick cannot finish a document
 * anyway: submission sets `nextPollAt` a few seconds out, so the poll that
 * retrieves the result belongs to a later tick. The pipeline is driven from the
 * request path instead — see `advanceDocumentProcessing()` in
 * `src/modules/documents/processing/advanceProcessing.ts`. What this endpoint is
 * for is the work no request will ever touch: runs abandoned by a crashed
 * worker, and documents whose conversion outlived the invocation that uploaded
 * them.
 *
 * Also runs `runInboundEmailWorkerTick()` as the durable backstop for inbound
 * email ingestion — it piggybacks on this slot rather than getting its own
 * scheduler job (see /api/cron/inbound-email-processing, still callable
 * directly). The webhook's own `after()` dispatch is what makes ingestion feel
 * immediate; this is only the safety net for whatever that missed. Same
 * arrangement as documents: a request does the work, and this endpoint catches
 * what no request will.

/**
 * Housekeeping for the AI usage counters, piggybacking on the daily slot for the

 * work does not deserve one of them.
 *
 * One row exists per account, user, surface and minute, so minute windows
 * accumulate quickly and nothing ever reads one from last month. Failure is
 * swallowed and reported — a metering table that cannot be swept must not turn a
 * document backstop into a 500.
