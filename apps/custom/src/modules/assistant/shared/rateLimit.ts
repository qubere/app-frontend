/**
 * A question quota for the Copilot.
 *
 * Every other limit in the Copilot bounds one question: how many tools it may
 * call, how many rows it may read, how long it may take. None of them bound how
 * many questions arrive. A stuck client, a scripted caller or an impatient user
 * holding Enter can therefore spend model tokens and database reads without
 * limit, which is the one cost control the rest of the design does not provide.
 *
 * Two windows, because they catch different things: the per-user window catches
 * one runaway session, and the per-account window catches a script that spreads
 * itself across several users of the same tenant.
 *
 * ## What this is not
 *
 * It is an in-memory counter, per server instance. On a fleet — or on serverless,
 * where instances come and go — the effective limit is the configured limit times
 * the number of warm instances, and a cold start forgets everything. That is an
 * honest weakness and it is written here rather than in a ticket: this is a
 * guard against runaway clients and accidents, not a defence against a
 * determined attacker, and it should be replaced by a shared counter (the same
 * store any future distributed quota uses) before the Copilot is exposed to
 * untrusted callers.
 *
 * Correctness never depends on it. A request it lets through is checked by every
 * other layer exactly as before.
