/**
 * What a Copilot tool is, and what it is allowed to be.
 *
 * A tool is a named, schema-bounded call onto a Qubere service that the caller
 * could already have made through the UI. That framing decides the shape:
 *
 *   - `input` is a zod schema, validated server-side before execution. Arguments
 *     a model invents that are not in the schema are rejected, not passed
 *     through.
 *   - `access` names the same nav route or permission that gates the equivalent
 *     screen, so Copilot can never be a softer door than the app itself.
 *   - `execute` receives an actor built from the session — never from arguments.
 *     There is no accountId parameter on any tool, so there is nothing to forge.
 *   - the result is a plain object bounded by copilotConfig limits, and every
 *     record it names is written to the grounding ledger as it is built.
 *
 * There is no tool that takes SQL, a URL, a file path, a shell command, or a
 * table name. That is a property of this registry, not a filter over it.

/**
 * How a tool is gated.
 *
 * `navHref` reuses `canAccessHref` from src/lib/navigation.ts, which is the same
 * function the sidebar and the routed pages use. A tool gated this way is
 * available exactly when the corresponding screen is.
 *
 * `permission` is for capabilities with a catalogued permission of their own.
 *
 * Omitting both means "any authenticated member of the account", which is what
 * the Exceptions, Decisions and Actions pages already are.
