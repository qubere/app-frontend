/**
 * How to present an AgentDecision for review, and which values a broker can
 * correct.
 *
 * Three categories, by how much a decision actually has to show a human:
 *
 * - MECHANICAL: pure pipeline plumbing (did the file get stitched, is the
 *   entry summary ready to file). No value to check, nothing to correct --
 *   there is nothing to ask the user, so it should not render as a
 *   reviewable line at all.
 * - FIELDS: the agent proposes one specific, well-defined value with its own
 *   database column -- today that's only HTS Classification's
 *   `proposedHtsCode`. Present or not, it's rendered as a single
 *   correctable field belonging to that decision.
 * - NARRATIVE: everything else (Document Intelligence, Origin, Valuation,
 *   Compliance, Product Intelligence) -- real content, but no
 *   decision-scoped field to edit. Shown as plain text, still fully
 *   reviewable (approve/reject/re-evaluate), just not editable here.
 *
 * Document Intelligence used to be a FIELDS decision, reading extracted
 * values out of its own `evidenceItems` copy. It isn't anymore: a shipment
 * can have several Document Intelligence decisions for the same document
 * (a real upload, a reattach event, a manual re-run), each with its own
 * independent, possibly-stale copy of the same facts, and evidenceItems only
 * ever carried 6 of the ~17 fields the agent actually extracts. The
 * document itself (ShipmentDocument.extractedJson.tradeMetadata) is the one
 * place with a single, current, complete copy -- see
 * `documentTradeFields` below, which is document-scoped rather than
 * decision-scoped and is rendered once per document, not once per decision.
 *
 * Shared between the API route (to apply an edit) and the UI (to render
 * fields and choose a category) so the two can't drift apart.
