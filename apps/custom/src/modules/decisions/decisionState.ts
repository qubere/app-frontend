/**
 * Decision status vocabulary.
 *
 * Agents wrote whichever string felt right — "Needs Review", "Review Required",
 * "Attention", blocked sentinels — resulting in four readers that each guessed
 * differently.  Every literal the codebase has ever written normalizes here.
 *
 * The canonical domain:
 *   NEEDS_REVIEW  — a human must look at this before it can be filed.
 *   AUTO_VERIFIED — the confidence policy passed; still needs the provenance
 *                   label so an auditor can tell it from a human approval.
 *   BLOCKED       — a prerequisite is missing; the decision cannot be acted
 *                   on until the blocker is cleared.
 *   APPROVED      — a licensed human reviewer approved it.
 *   REJECTED      — a licensed human reviewer rejected it.
 *   IN_PROGRESS   — re-evaluation requested; the agent is re-running.
 *   COMPLETED     — the agent run is done; rolled up from the pipeline, not
 *                   a terminal state for the individual decision.
