/**
 * Filing readiness, computed from what the shipment record actually holds.
 *
 * The Filing Readiness Agent scores a pipeline run from flags the caller passes
 * in. That is fine for a pipeline, but it cannot answer the question a broker
 * asks while looking at a shipment: can this entry be filed right now, and if
 * not, what is missing? This module answers that from stored columns only.
 *
 * Every check here is a check that is genuinely performed. There is deliberately
 * no bond check, no PGA check and no licence check, because no column carries
 * the answer — claiming to have verified them would be worse than not listing
 * them at all.
