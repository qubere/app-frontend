/**
 * Driving the document pipeline from the request path.
 *
 * Vercel's Hobby plan schedules cron at most once a day, and a single tick
 * cannot finish a document in any case: submission sets `nextPollAt` a few
 * seconds into the future, so the poll that retrieves the result belongs to a
 * later tick. Under a daily cron that arithmetic produces a document parsed two
 * days after it was uploaded. That is not a slow pipeline, it is a broken one.
 *
 * So requests drive it. `after()` runs this once the response has already been
 * sent — on Vercel it is implemented with `waitUntil`, which extends the
 * invocation rather than blocking the client — so the user waits for nothing and
 * the document still reaches the parser within seconds of upload. Where the
 * conversion is quick, the same invocation polls it to completion.
 *
 * This calls the same `runWorkerTick()` as the cron endpoint and the
 * long-running worker, with the same guarantee: every transition is a
 * conditional update against the durable Postgres run, so overlapping callers
 * cannot double-apply one, and running all three at once is safe.
 *
 * Like them, it drains work for **every** tenant rather than only the caller's.
 * It is a system worker that happens to be started by a request; each run is
 * processed in its own account's context, and no data crosses between them. The
 * alternative — scoping the drain to the caller's account — would leave a
 * tenant's documents stalled purely because that tenant happened to be idle.
 *
 * What this is *not* is a replacement for the backstop. An invocation can be
 * frozen, a deploy can cut it short, and a conversion can outlive the budget.
 * Anything left behind is picked up by the daily cron or by the next request
 * that calls in here, because the run state lives in Postgres and not in this
 * process.

 * air under the 60s Hobby ceiling for both, and still covers a submission plus
 * several polls at the default 5s/10s/20s backoff. An invocation killed
 * mid-poll is a provider call paid for and thrown away, so the loop stops early
 * rather than being cut off. Raise it alongside `maxDuration` on Pro.
