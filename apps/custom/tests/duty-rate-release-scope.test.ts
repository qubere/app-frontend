/**
 * A duty rate decides what an importer legally owes, so it may only ever come
 * from the currently PUBLISHED HTS release.
 *
 * The same HTS number exists in every ingested release. An unfiltered lookup
 * returned whichever row the database handed back last, which in practice meant:
 *
 *   - a DRAFT staged overnight by the nightly USITC refresh, carrying no duty
 *     rates at all, so a rated line silently became "unrated" and a filing that
 *     had been transmittable yesterday was refused today; or
 *   - a SUPERSEDED release, carrying a rate from a schedule that no longer
 *     applies, which would price the declaration against retired law.
 *
 * Which one you got depended on row order. These tests pin the release scope.
