# Qubere Platform Data Refresh Policy & Dataset Master Architecture

## 1. Overview & Operational Principles

The Qubere Platform relies on authoritative trade data, tariff schedules, sanctions lists, regulatory notices, and rules of origin to power classification, landed cost calculations, trade agreement qualification, screening, and audit defense.

To guarantee maximum fidelity, transparency, and operational readiness:

- **No Synthetic Fallbacks in Production**: Operational calculations derive strictly from verified government and multilateral sources.
- **Honest Readiness Status**: Each dataset carries a `readinessStatus` of `LIVE` (ingestion fully wired and active: `hts-schedule`, `federal-register`, `bis-csl`, `cbp-cross-rulings`, `ofac-sdn`, `uflpa-entity-list`) or `NOT_YET_IMPLEMENTED` (planned on engineering roadmap). The Platform Admin `<Data>` tab clearly distinguishes these — "Run Now" is only available for `LIVE` datasets. Un-wired datasets return HTTP 422 and never fake a success response.
- **Staging & Approval Workflow**: High-impact rate modifications (HTSUS schedule, Section 301/232 annex revisions, AD/CVD company rates, Section 301 exclusions) stage as `PENDING`/`DRAFT` for platform administrator review before affecting production calculations. Same pattern applied to LLM-extracted data.
- **Point-in-Time Versioning for Screening**: `ScreeningEntity` (OFAC SDN, BIS CSL) uses `DRAFT → PUBLISHED → SUPERSEDED` versioning — enabling "what was this party's sanction status on date X?" queries for audit defensibility.
- **Zero-Downtime Delta Processing**: Differential updates compute SHA-256 node hashes and audit changes (`HtsChange`) without blocking live calculation engines.
- **Circuit Breaker Protection**: Ingestion pipelines automatically reject empty payloads (0-item yields) to prevent database truncation or corruption.
- **Single Dispatcher Cron**: Vercel Hobby plan supports 2 cron entries. One entry (`/api/cron/data-dispatcher` at `0 2 * * *`) fans out to all `LIVE` datasets based on `scheduledFrequencyHours` vs `lastSuccessAt` from the `DatasetRefreshLog` table.
- **Staleness Alerting**: The dispatcher checks `staleThresholdHours` for every dataset on each run. Any dataset exceeding its threshold triggers a `Notification` (`dataset_staleness_alert`) and an `AuditLog` event.
- **Heavy Parses via Inngest**: XML streaming (OFAC), PDF/OCR extraction (Section 301), and LLM batch extraction (AD/CVD company rates) run as durable Inngest background functions with retry semantics — not synchronously in POST handlers at risk of Vercel timeout.
- **Persistent Run Log**: `DatasetRefreshLog` DB table is the source of truth for last-run timestamps and status displayed in the `<Data>` tab. There is no in-memory state.

## 2. Dataset Master Registry (19 Datasets)

Below is the comprehensive operational policy for all 19 datasets required across the platform.

### Group A: Free — Public Government Sources (Machine-Readable APIs)

| Dataset | Powers / Purpose | Source & Provider | Cost | How Refreshed | Frequency | SLA & Failure Policy |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **HTSUS Schedule** | HTS classification, duty rates, tariff scenarios, landed cost calculation engine | `hts.usitc.gov/reststop/exportList` (USITC REST API) | Free | Automated JSON REST API fetcher & hierarchical tree builder. Node hash comparison detects changes. Staged into `HtsRelease` (`DRAFT`) for review. | Daily (02:00 UTC) | 0-item circuit breaker; auto-retries 3x with exponential backoff. Admin alert on failure. |
| **CBP CROSS Rulings** | Legal precedent retrieval, classification evidence matching, AI citation reasoning | `rulings.cbp.gov/api/search` (CBP REST API, 1k req/day) | Free | Incremental date-window query fetching new ruling numbers, HQ/NY locations, text body, and HTS classifications. Indexed into `pgvector`. | Daily (06:00 UTC) | API quota throttling protection (max 10 req/sec); rate-limit awareness fallback. |
| **BIS Consolidated Screening List (CSL)** | Denied party screening, restricted entity checks, sanctions compliance engine | `api.trade.gov/v1/consolidated_screening_list/search` | Free | Standardized JSON transformer normalizing 10 agency lists (SDN, DPL, Entity List, UVL, ISN, SSI, FSE, PLC, NS-MBS) into unified entity schema. | Daily (04:00 UTC) | Atomic table swap; fuzzy index (Levenshtein + token set ratio) re-indexed post-ingest. |
| **OFAC SDN + Consolidated Non-SDN** | Specially Designated Nationals (SDN) screening, sanctions enforcement | `www.treasury.gov/ofac/downloads/{sdn,consolidated/consolidated}.xml` | Free | Streaming SAX parser (`saxes`) reads `sdn.xml` and `consolidated.xml` directly (never buffers the ~29MB file), upserting into `ScreeningEntity` in chunked batches. Runs as an Inngest background function (own native cron, zero `vercel.json` slots). | Daily (05:00 UTC) | Parsed count must equal the feed's own `Record_Count` header (hard circuit breaker) or nothing is written; CSV row count is fetched as a secondary cross-check. Delisted entities move to `SUPERSEDED`, not deleted. |
| **UFLPA Entity List** | Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act entity screening | DHS UFLPA Entity List | Free | Real fetcher (`src/app/api/cron/uflpa-entity-list-ingest`) upserting into `ScreeningEntity`. | Daily | `DatasetRefreshLog` RUNNING/SUCCESS/FAILED run tracking, same pattern as the other screening-list ingesters. |
| **Federal Register (CBP Notices)** | Regulatory monitoring, AD/CVD alerts, tariff changes, retroactive exclusion detection | `federalregister.gov/api/v1/documents.json` | Free | REST API document fetch + Gemini 3.6 Flash AI structured extraction (`extractionSchema`). Auto-generates `RefundOpportunity` records. | Daily (08:00 UTC) | Duplicate document number check; heuristic fallback if AI extraction API is unreachable. |

| **CBP Import Trade Trend Statistics** | Audit population analytics benchmarks, macro volume profiling | `cbp.gov/trade/trade-community/import-statistics` | Free | Monthly XLSX report stream parser extracting entry counts, customs values, duty collected, and top commodity sectors. | Monthly | Populates `CbpImportTrend` time-series table; feeds risk scoring engine. |
| **USITC DataWeb (Import Statistics)** | Duty opportunity benchmarking, landed cost optimization | `dataweb.usitc.gov/api/v1/imports` | Free | REST API query transformer mapping 10-digit HTS codes, Country of Origin, Customs Value, Calculated Duties, and Quantity. | Monthly | Aggregated into historical benchmarking table `UsitcImportStats`. |
| **WTO Tariff Download Facility** | Tariff scenario modeling, non-US sourcing alternatives, global trade agreement comparison | `tariffdata.wto.org` | Free | Bulk CSV & REST API converter mapping 6-digit HS subheadings, MFN bound/applied rates, and preferential rates across 160+ countries. | Semi-Annually | Populates `WtoTariffMatrix` for global supply chain shift modeling. |

## 3. Maintenance, Circuit Breakers & Staging Policy

1. **Staging & Audit Trail**:
   - Updates to primary tariff schedules (HTSUS, Section 301, Section 232) are written as `DRAFT` releases. Platform administrators can inspect diffs (`HtsChange`) and execute automated regression tests before publishing to production.

2. **Circuit Breakers**:
   - If an automated fetch returns 0 records or a HTTP error status, the ingestion pipeline halts immediately and alerts administrators. Existing production data remains active and untouched.

3. **Manual Triggering ("Run Now")**:
   - Platform administrators can trigger immediate synchronization for any of the 19 datasets via the **Platform Admin Console** (`/platform-admin` -> `<Data>` tab).

4. **Audit Logging**:
   - Every refresh execution logs an `AuditLog` event (`DATASET_REFRESH`) recording dataset ID, execution duration, item count, status, and triggered user/cron context.
